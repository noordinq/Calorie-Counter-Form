This is a calorie counter form that is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It is used to get user inputs, validate them and also perform calculations based from the inputs.
The interface is also dynamically updated to show the results. 
They are then compared to the calorie budget entered by the user and determined whether they are in a Caloric Surplus or a Caloric Deficit. 
A couple template literals have been used throughtout the code.
